# Security Policy

The security of this project is taken seriously. We appreciate your efforts to
responsibly disclose any findings and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided only for the latest released version of this
app. Users are strongly encouraged to keep their installations up to date.

| Version        | Supported          |
| -------------- | ------------------ |

| Older releases | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, report them privately through GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting:

[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/hassio-addons/app-nginx-proxy-manager/security/advisories/new)

If for any reason you are unable to use GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting, you may also reach out to the maintainer by email at
[opensource@frenck.dev](mailto:opensource@frenck.dev).

When reporting, please include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof of concept.
- Affected version(s) of the app.
- Any known mitigations or workarounds.

## Disclosure Timeline

- **Acknowledgement:** you will receive an acknowledgement of your report
  within **48 hours**.
- **Initial assessment:** a triage and initial severity assessment will be
  shared within **7 days** of the acknowledgement.
- **Fix and disclosure:** valid reports are targeted for resolution and
  coordinated public disclosure within **90 days** of the initial report,
  depending on complexity and impact.

You will be kept informed throughout the process and credited in the release
notes for the fix, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Out of Scope

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities in this project:

- Vulnerabilities in upstream or transitive dependencies. These are handled
  continuously by [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and
  addressed through regular dependency updates.
- Issues in Nginx Proxy Manager itself; please report those directly to the
  [Nginx Proxy Manager project](https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager/security/policy).
- Issues in Home Assistant, its Supervisor, or the operating system the app
  runs on; please report those to the
  [Home Assistant project](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/policy).
- Issues only reproducible on app versions older than the latest release.
- Exposure resulting from deliberately publishing the app's ports to an
  untrusted network without further protection. The app assumes the
  administrator controls how it is exposed.

## Scope

This security policy covers the Nginx Proxy Manager Home Assistant app
published from this repository, including its container image and the
configuration and scripts that ship with it.
